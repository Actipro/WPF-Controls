# Overview

Wizard follows WPF best practices for areas such as layout, globalization and accessibility.

Some of the more major features include:

- Adheres to the Wizard97 and Aero Wizard specifications.
- Easily create wizard user interfaces in XAML markup.
- All parts of the wizard use [automatic layout](automatic-layout.md) so that they are capable of growing as needed.
- [Right-to-left support](flow-direction.md) is fully integrated for languages such as Hebrew or Arabic.
- All text properties use [localization attributes](localization.md).
- Follows the WPF accessibility model for [UI automation](ui-automation.md).
