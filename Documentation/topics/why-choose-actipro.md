# Why Choose Actipro Products?

## Experience

Actipro Software has been developing Windows Forms components since .NET was first released, and has been working on commercial WPF control development since WPF was first introduced in 2006.

> [!NOTE]
> Actipro Wizard was the very first commercial UI control for WPF from any component vendor, released back in December 2006.

We've become very familiar with the in's and out's of WPF and have architected our products to implement WPF best practices.  Our object models are very refined and easy to work with.

## Documentation, Samples, and Designer Support

We realize that creating a good product is only half the battle in product development.  The other half is providing thorough product documentation, samples, and having rich design-time functionality to aid in development efficiency.

We've spent a lot of time creating extensive documentation along with numerous product demos and QuickStarts so that you can get up and running with our products in minutes.

All our products also have designer interaction support when used in Visual Studio or Expression Blend.

## Attention to Detail

Unlike most software vendors who slap together products just to get them out the door making money, we prefer to distinguish ourselves by taking a different approach to software development.

At Actipro, we pay attention to the minute details.  We add that extra polish to our products that really makes the difference to developers and end users alike.

## Quality, Not Quantity

Sure, other competitor companies may offer a couple more controls than we do, but rest assured that our products are well thought out and have enormous feature sets that you won't find anywhere else.

> [!NOTE]
> We run our control product source code through Visual Studio's Code Analyzer and resolve all warnings it generates.  This ensures that our code is well-designed and meets all appropriate .NET standards.

## Customer Satisfaction

Every day we strive to please our customers. Are you used to waiting a week for a response from other vendors?  Not at Actipro. We always try to reply to customers within one business day, and are frequently told we provide top-notch support to our customers.

> [!NOTE]
> Organizations across the globe from over 100 countries own Actipro products

## Save Time and Money

Simply stated, we've put hundreds of hours into the design and development of our products so that you don't have to.  Why spend weeks developing in-house custom user interface controls when ours are already mature and can be purchased for the cost of several hours of development time?

## You Speak, We Listen

We love to hear your feedback and often drive our products' designs based on the needs of our customers.
