# Overview

The XYChart control contains several features that can be used to customize the appearance and data.

## Axes

Axes control the range of values that are visible in a chart, and also can display ticks, labels, titles, and other elements.

See the [Axes](axes.md) topic for more information.

## Bar Chart Custom Styles

Bar Charts can be customized to have a unique look that fits your needs.

See the [Bar Chart Custom Styles](bar-chart-custom-styles.md) topic for more information.

## Baseline

A baseline value can be used to alter the look of area, bar, and win/loss series, and can be optionally displayed on the chart.

See the [Baseline](baseline.md) topic for more information.

## Data Aggregation

The chart control supports aggregating its data to reduce the number of data points displayed.

See the [Data Aggregation](data-aggregation.md) topic for more information.

## Data Point Labels

Data point labels allow you to show the values of a given data point.

See the [Data Point Labels](data-point-labels.md) topic for more information.

## Grid Lines and Stripes

Grid lines and stripes appear behind the chart data and allow the user to easily compare data against axis values.

See the [Grid Lines and Stripes](grid-lines-and-stripes.md) topic for more information.

## Legend

A legend can provide context for what each series in a chart represents.  Legends are fully stylable and can be customized to match the look and feel of your application.

See the [Legend](legend.md) topic for more information.

## Palettes

There are an enormous number of configuration options related to palettes.  The various brushes used by the chart can be easily customized using a palette of colors or the styles can be completely overridden.

See the [Palettes](palettes.md) topic for more information.

## Ranges

Specific value ranges of the chart can be highlighted to convey additional information to the end-user.

See the [Ranges](ranges.md) topic for more information.

## Series Visibility

The visibility of any series can be set to dictate whether or not it is rendered on the chart.

See the [Series Visibility](series-visibility.md) topic for more information.

## Specifying Items

The chart control can be bound to any custom data source and supports several data types.

See the [Specifying Items](specifying-items.md) topic for more information.
