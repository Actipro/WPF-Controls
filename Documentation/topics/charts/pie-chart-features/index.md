# Overview

Pie charts have several features that allow you to customize their function and appearance to meet your needs.

## Customizing Appearance

Several properties allow you to change the colors used for the pie slices, along with other elements in pie charts.

See the [Customizing Appearance](customizing-appearance.md) topic for more information.

## Donut Chart

Donut charts act just like pie charts, except for an adjustable donut hole in the center of the chart.

See the [Donut Chart](donut-chart.md) topic for more information.

## Legend

A legend can provide context for what each pie slice represents.  Legends are fully stylable to match the look and feel of your application.

See the [Legend](legend.md) topic for more information.

## Multiple Series

Pie charts and donut charts can contain multiple series, displayed as concentric rings.  They also support hierarchical data, displaying a child ring outside or inside the parent.

See the [Multiple Series](multiple-series.md) topic for more information.

## 'Other' Slice

Small slices can be aggregated into an 'Other' slice. This can be based on a numeric threshold or a percentage.

See the ['Other' Slice](other-slice.md) topic for more information.

## Pie Slice Labels

Labels can be displayed on each pie slice and fully customized.

See the [Pie Slice Labels](pie-slice-labels.md) topic for more information.

## Specifying Items

Pie / donut charts can be bound to any custom data source as long as it contains a numeric value to determine pie slice percentages from.

See the [Specifying Items](specifying-items.md) topic for more information.
