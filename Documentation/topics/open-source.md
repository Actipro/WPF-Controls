# GitHub Open-Source

Actipro hosts an open-source WPF Controls repository on GitHub:

[https://github.com/Actipro/WPF-Controls](https://github.com/Actipro/WPF-Controls)

## Repository Contents

While the repository doesn't contain the source code for our commercial WPF controls, it does contain a lot of related material including:

- The Sample Browser application project's source code
- Other sample projects' source code
- This documentation's source Markdown topic files
- Open-source control library code:
  - Companion to the Bars product that supports easy MVVM integration
  - Enhancement libraries for the Microsoft WPF DataGrid

## Support and Contributing

For support of our closed-source UI control products, please use the support options described in the [Support](support.md) topic.  Do not submit a GitHub issue for control product support.

We welcome contributions by our customers!  If you have an idea for improving our samples, documentation, or one of the open-source libraries (basically anything whose source is in the repository), please submit a GitHub issue to discuss the idea with us.  We may then ask you to create a pull request with code changes for the idea.
