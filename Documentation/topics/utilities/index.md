# Overview

The Sample Browser application includes several utilities that we developed to help aid our customers in working with our products.

These utilities are available from the View menu within the Sample Browser's title bar.

## Color Browser

The Color Browser is a helpful utility that displays all the current `Color` values found in the static `Colors` and `SystemColors` class properties.

See the [Color Browser](color-browser.md) topic for information on this utility.

## String Resource Browser

The String Resource Browser can be used to view all the string resources that are used in Actipro's WPF control products.  It even helps you generate code that lets you customize or localize the string resources.

See the [String Resource Browser](string-resource-browser.md) topic for information on this utility.

## System Parameters Browser

The SystemParameters Browser is a helpful utility that displays all the values found in the static `SystemParameters` class properties.

See the [System Parameters Browser](system-parameters-browser.md) topic for information on this utility.
