# HorizontalListBox

The [HorizontalListBox](xref:@ActiproUIRoot.Controls.HorizontalListBox) control is a restyled native `ListBox` that arranges its items in a uniform width horizontally, and without a `ScrollBar`.

*A HorizontalListBox providing selection between several options.*

Since the control inherits `ListBox`, all features found on the native `ListBox` can also be used, such as single or multiple selection modes.
