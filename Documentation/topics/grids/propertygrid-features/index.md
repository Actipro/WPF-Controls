# Overview

[PropertyGrid](xref:@ActiproUIRoot.Controls.Grids.PropertyGrid) allows for all the properties of one or more objects to be displayed, optionally using categories.  Pre-defined editors for modifying properties are auto-generated based on property type, and custom property/category editors can be easily created, allowing for total customization of the property editing experience.

The PropertyGrid control's items can be populated simply by binding to a target data object (or data objects), by adding pre-defined property models to a properties collection, or by making a custom data factory.

Several property editors are included, which leverage existing native controls for value display and editing.  Custom property or category editors can be used as well, to provide a highly-tailored presentation for your needs.

## Features

### PropertyGrid Control

- Displays a grid of all accessible properties for one or more objects, with full UI virtualization support.
- Based on TreeListView, thereby inheriting all of it and TreeListBox's UI customization features.
- Numerous built-in property editors are provided, and custom property editors can be created to customize the look and/or feel of a given property.
- Property editors can be tied to a property by name, Type, or both, which allows for all properties of a specified Type to use the same editor.
- A model-based data factory architecture allows for complete low-level customization of the property item presented.
- Explicitly-defined property models can be used in place of, or in addition to, any property models dynamically-generated by a factory.
