# Overview

## Ribbon Resizing

Actipro Ribbon has the most powerful and flexible ribbon resizing model of any ribbon control out there. In fact it's capabilities match what Office can do!

See the [Ribbon Resizing](ribbon-resizing.md) topic for more information.

## Ribbon Minimization

Actipro Ribbon supports minimization, which means that the ribbon may be hidden so that only its tabs appear.  In this state, more screen real estate is available to the client area of the window.  By clicking a tab, the ribbon appears in a popup over the window client area and all of its controls are accessible.

See the [Ribbon Minimization](ribbon-minimization.md) topic for more information.

## Ribbon Collapsing

The ribbon is capable of collapsing when it becomes smaller than a threshold size.  When in a collapsed state, the ribbon (including its application button and QAT) hides since there is not enough space for its interface.

See the [Ribbon Collapsing](ribbon-collapsing.md) topic for more information.

## Screen Tips

Actipro Ribbon fully implements screen tips for controls, which are advanced variations of standard tooltips.

See the [Screen Tips](screen-tips.md) topic for more information.

## Key Tips

Actipro Ribbon supports key tips, which are small decorations that pop up over each control indicating a key or series of keys that may be typed to access each control via the keyboard.

See the [Key Tips](key-tips.md) topic for more information.

## Flow Direction

Ribbon supports both left-to-right and right-to-left layouts via a simple property switch.

See the [Flow Direction](flow-direction.md) topic for more information.

## Localization

All of the text properties found within the ribbon suite have localization attributes applied to them and any dynamically-used text in the user interface can be localized.

See the [Localization](localization.md) topic for more information.

## UI Automation

This product follows the WPF accessibility model for UI automation.

See the [UI Automation](ui-automation.md) topic for more information.
