# Overview

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This older Ribbon product will be deprecated in the future in favor of the new ribbon implementation in the [Bars product](../../bars/index.md), which has a much-improved design and appearance, and many of the latest features currently found in Office.  It is recommended to implement new ribbons using the Bars product instead, and to [migrate away from this older Ribbon product](../../conversion/converting-to-v23-1.md) to the newer Bars ribbon when possible.

Actipro Ribbon has been designed from the ground up to mimic Office themes, yet allow further customization, and make complete use of WPF styles.

Ribbon includes all three built-in Office themes, all Windows system themes, allows you to generate themes of your own with one line of code, and even allows you to examine or modify any of the hundreds of colors used in each color scheme.

Ribbon comes packaged with a number of styles that may be reused in your own controls (such as listboxes) so that you can keep a consistent user interface throughout your application.

## Application Button Content

Ribbon supports several different layout and content styles for the application button.

See the [Application Button Content](app-button-content.md) topic for more information.

## Themes

Ribbon uses hundreds of brushes to define the themes used throughout the ribbon user interface and comes packaged with nine default themes.  Brushes may be reused in your application to help you maintain a consistent user interface.

See the [Themes](themes.md) topic for more information.
