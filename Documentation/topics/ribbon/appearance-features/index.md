# Overview

Actipro Ribbon has been designed from the ground up to mimic Office themes, yet allow further customization, and make complete use of WPF styles.

Ribbon includes all three built-in Office themes, all Windows system themes, allows you to generate themes of your own with one line of code, and even allows you to examine or modify any of the hundreds of colors used in each color scheme.

Ribbon comes packaged with a number of styles that may be reused in your own controls (such as listboxes) so that you can keep a consistent user interface throughout your application.

## Application Button Content

Ribbon support several different layout and content styles for the application button.

See the [Application Button Content](app-button-content.md) topic for more information.

## Themes

Ribbon uses hundreds of brushes to define the themes used throughout the ribbon user interface and comes packaged with nine default themes.  Brushes may be reused in your application to help you maintain a consistent user interface.

See the [Themes](themes.md) topic for more information.
