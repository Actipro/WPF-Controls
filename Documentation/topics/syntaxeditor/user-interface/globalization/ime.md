# IME (Input Method Editor) Support

SyntaxEditor has complete support for editing text using IME (Input Method Editor).

IME is a Window feature that allows users to enter characters and symbols not found on their input device.  It allows Western keyboards to enter Chinese, Japanese, etc. characters.

IME support is enabled by default.  To disable it for any reason, set the [SyntaxEditor](xref:@ActiproUIRoot.Controls.SyntaxEditor.SyntaxEditor).[IsImeEnabled](xref:@ActiproUIRoot.Controls.SyntaxEditor.SyntaxEditor.IsImeEnabled) property to `false`.
