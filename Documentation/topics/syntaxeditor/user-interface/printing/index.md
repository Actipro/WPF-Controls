# Overview

SyntaxEditor's print features include easy dialog access, many print options, and customizable margins.

## Print Dialogs

SyntaxEditor provides easy access to built-in print dialogs.

See the [Print Dialogs](dialogs.md) topic for more information.

## Print Options

There are a large number of options available that affect how printouts render.

See the [Print Options](print-options.md) topic for more information.

## Printer View Margins

While the SyntaxEditor printer views have numerous built-in margins (document title, page number, etc.), SyntaxEditor offers an extensibility point where custom margins can be created and added to printer views in any location.

See the [Printer View Margins](printer-view-margins.md) topic for more information.

## Printing to XPS

Any SyntaxEditor document content can be printed out to XPS format with a few lines of code.

See the [Printing to XPS](xps.md) topic for more information.
