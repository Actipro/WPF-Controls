# Extension Methods

The Acitpro WPF DataGrid Contrib assembly includes extension methods defined in the [DataGridExtensions](xref:ActiproSoftware.Windows.Controls.DataGrid.DataGridExtensions) static class, which are described in this topic.

> [!NOTE]
> The extension methods described in this topic can be applied to the WPF `DataGrid` or the [ThemedDataGrid](xref:ActiproSoftware.Windows.Controls.DataGrid.ThemedDataGrid) .

## DataGrid

The following extension methods are provided for the `DataGrid` type:

| Method | Description |
|-----|-----|
| [GetRow](xref:ActiproSoftware.Windows.Controls.DataGrid.DataGridExtensions.GetRow*) | There are two overloads for this method, each of which returns a `DataGridRow`. One overload takes the index of the row to return. The second overload returns the row associated with a specified item. |
