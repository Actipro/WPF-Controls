# Overview

## Book

The [Book](xref:@ActiproUIRoot.Controls.Views.Book) control is an `ItemsControl` that presents the items as pages in a book.

See the [Book](book.md) topic for more information.

## InertiaScrollViewer

The [InertiaScrollViewer](xref:@ActiproUIRoot.Controls.Views.InertiaScrollViewer) is a smooth-scrolling `ScrollViewer`-like control that reacts to touch and continues gliding to a stop when flicked.

See the [InertiaScrollViewer](inertia-scroll-viewer.md) topic for more information.

## Settings Controls

The [SettingsCard](xref:@ActiproUIRoot.Controls.Views.SettingsCard), [SettingsExpander](xref:@ActiproUIRoot.Controls.Views.SettingsExpander), and [SettingsGroup](xref:@ActiproUIRoot.Controls.Views.SettingsGroup) controls are used together to organize and present configurable settings.

See the [SettingsCard](settings-card.md), [Settings Expander](settings-expander.md), and [SettingsGroup](settings-group.md) topics for more information.

## TaskBoard

The [TaskBoard](xref:@ActiproUIRoot.Controls.Views.TaskBoard) control makes it easy to add interactive task scheduling and prioritization to your apps.  A task board consists of zero to many columns, each of which can contain zero to many cards.  Columns and cards can be dragged around and reordered, all using pleasing sway animations.

See the [TaskBoard](taskboard.md) topic for more information.
