## Book

See the [Book](book.md) topic for more information.

## InertiaScrollViewer

The [InertiaScrollViewer](xref:ActiproSoftware.Windows.Controls.Views.InertiaScrollViewer) is a smooth-scrolling ScrollViewer-like control that reacts to touch and continues gliding to a stop when flicked.

## TaskBoard

The [TaskBoard](xref:ActiproSoftware.Windows.Controls.Views.TaskBoard) control makes it easy to add interactive task scheduling and prioritization to your apps.  A task board consists of zero to many columns, each of which can contain zero to many cards.  Columns and cards can be dragged around and reordered, all using pleasing sway animations.

See the [TaskBoard](taskboard.md) topic for more information.
