# Sample Code and QuickStarts

Actipro WPF Studio includes many demos and QuickStarts in the sample project.

We pride ourselves in providing more full-source samples than our competition, allowing you to learn our products easier and avoid having to rewrite common logic and design patterns.

## What is a Demo?

A demo is a large sample that shows the combination of many product features together to create a finished product.

Demos are intended to show some ideas of what you can do with our products when you use them in your own applications.

## What is a QuickStart?

A QuickStart is a small sample that is focused on a particular feature area or how to perform a certain task.

QuickStarts are the place to go to quickly learn how to get a specific feature working without having to navigate around unrelated code needed to support other features.

## Reusing Sample Source Code

The full source for all samples is located in the sample project and you are free to reuse the sample source code as you wish.

We encourage you to copy what you need to help you get started with using the product in your own applications.

## Visual Studio Item Templates

Many of our WPF Studio products also come with packed with item templates for Visual Studio.  When getting started using our products in your own applications, use the item templates to get up and running quickly.

Each product's `Getting Started` topic discusses any Visual Studio item templates that are available.
