# Overview

Breadcrumb is a control that presents a selected item from a hierarchy in a linear fashion.

Some of the more major features include:

- Duplicates all functionality found in the Windows Vista explorer breadcrumb control.
- Multiple built-in themes.
- Allows the [selected item](item-selection.md) to be set using numerous methods.
- Includes an [edit mode](edit-mode.md), which allows the selected path to be modified directly.
- Fully customizable [drop-down list](edit-mode.md), which can contain recent items, favorite items, or any other custom items.
- [Auto-minimizes](auto-minimize.md) any number of non-selected items.
- [Hides](overflow.md) items when the selected trail cannot fit into the current width of the control.
- Integrated [progress bar](progressbar.md), which is displayed in the background.
- Support for [tail items](tail-items.md), which allow for faster navigation down the hierarchy.
- Support for custom [action buttons](action-buttons.md) shown on the right side of the control.
- Support for [HierarchicalDataTemplate](hierarchical-data.md).
