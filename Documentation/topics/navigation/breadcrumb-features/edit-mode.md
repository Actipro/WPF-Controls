# Edit Mode

The [Breadcrumb](xref:@ActiproUIRoot.Controls.Navigation.Breadcrumb) control supports an edit mode, in which the user can manually type a new path or select an item from a drop-down list. The edit mode is supported using an embedded `ComboBox`, whose drop-down items can be fully customized. Typically, this list would include recently selected items and/or favorite items.

The user can enter edit mode by:

- Pressing the <kbd>Space</kbd> key when the breadcrumb has the keyboard focus

- Clicking on the icon on the left

- Clicking in the empty space on the right

- Opening the drop-down list

The user can exit edit mode by:

- Pressing the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key when the text box has the keyboard focus

- Pressing the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key when the text box has the keyboard focus (**any changes will be discarded**)

- Selecting an item from the drop-down list

- Moving focus away from the [Breadcrumb](xref:@ActiproUIRoot.Controls.Navigation.Breadcrumb) control (**any changes will be discarded**)

## Disabling Edit Mode

The edit mode can be disabled by setting the [IsEditable](xref:@ActiproUIRoot.Controls.Navigation.Breadcrumb.IsEditable) property to `false`. When the edit mode is disabled, the drop-down list is hidden and the user cannot directly enter a path.

## Populating the Drop-Down List

The embedded combo box drop-down list is populated using the [ComboBoxItemsSource](xref:@ActiproUIRoot.Controls.Navigation.Breadcrumb.ComboBoxItemsSource) property. This property can be set in the same manner as the `ComboBox.ItemsSource` property.

> [!NOTE]
> Logic to convert a combo box item to a trail must be provided. See the [Item Conversion](item-conversion.md) topic for more information.
