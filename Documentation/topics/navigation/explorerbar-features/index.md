# Overview

Explorer bar is an implementation of the task bar that was introduced in Windows XP's explorer.

Some of the more major features include:

- Duplicates all functionality found in the Windows XP explorer bar.
- Multiple built-in themes.
- Displays a vertical list of expanders that use [animation to fade and slide](expand-collapse.md) when expanding/collapsing.
- Optionally only allow [one expander to be expanded at a time](expand-collapse.md).
- [Alternate style](headers-and-content.md) can be applied to an individual expander to give it emphasis.
- Place [text and images](headers-and-content.md) in expander headers.
- Vertical scrollbar automatically added when expanders exceed container height.
