# Overview

Navigation follows WPF best practices for areas such as layout, globalization and accessibility.

Some of the more major features include:

- [Right-to-left support](flow-direction.md) is fully integrated for languages such as Hebrew or Arabic.

- All text properties use [localization attributes](localization.md).

- Follows the WPF accessibility model for [UI automation](ui-automation.md).
