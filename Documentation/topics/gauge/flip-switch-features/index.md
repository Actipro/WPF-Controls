# Overview

The [FlipSwitch](xref:ActiproSoftware.Windows.Controls.Gauge.FlipSwitch) control can be broken down into separate areas, which are described below.  Additional topics are provided for areas that require more detailed explanations.

## Frames

[FlipSwitch](xref:ActiproSoftware.Windows.Controls.Gauge.FlipSwitch) supports the same frame features as [CircularGauge](xref:ActiproSoftware.Windows.Controls.Gauge.CircularGauge), for more information see the [CircularGauge Frames](../circular-gauge-features/frames.md) topic.

> [!NOTE]
> The `FlipSwitch` control defaults the [BackgroundType](xref:ActiproSoftware.Windows.Controls.Gauge.Primitives.CircularGaugeBase.BackgroundType) to [None](xref:ActiproSoftware.Windows.Controls.Gauge.CircularBackgroundType.None), which differs from the `CircularGauge`.

## Switch

[FlipSwitch](xref:ActiproSoftware.Windows.Controls.Gauge.FlipSwitch) supports two or three check states, and includes several options for customizing the look of the switch.

See the [Switch](switch.md) topic for more information.
