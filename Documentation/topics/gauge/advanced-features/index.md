# Overview

There are some advanced features supported by the gauge controls, which are discussed in the section.

## Embedding Controls

All three gauge controls can host any `UIElement`, such as adding a `TextBlock` element for custom labeling.

See the [Embedding Controls](embedding-controls.md) topic for more information.

## Converters

Gauge comes with a few built-in converters that provide additional features for use with the gauge controls.

See the [Converters](converters.md) topic for more information.
