# Overview

It's easy to use any simple or complex objects as data sources for charts, and data aggregation is fully supported.

## Specifying Items

The chart control can be bound to any custom data source and supports several data types.

See the [Specifying Items](specifying-items.md) topic for more information.

## Data Aggregation

The chart control supports aggregating its data to reduce the number of data points displayed.

See the [Data Aggregation](data-aggregation.md) topic for more information.
