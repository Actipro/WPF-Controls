A heat map is a grid where each cell renders color and/or size differences to reflect data values. The MicroHeatMapPresenter control is the marker used in each heat map cell, and automatically handles the color and/or size rendering for its particular data value representation.

![Screenshot](../images/micro-segment-chart.png)

A segment chart provides a visual representation of an integer value in relation to a total number.  Each segment in the chart is rendered as highlighted or unhighlighted.  For instance, if the value is 3 of 10, there will be 10 total segments displayed, with the first 3 rendering as highlighted.  This sort of chart is great for use on dashboards, and also as an indicator of steps or progress achieved.
