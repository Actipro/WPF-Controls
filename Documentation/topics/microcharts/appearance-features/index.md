# Overview

The chart control contains several other features that can be used to customize the appearance.

## Baseline

A baseline value can be used to alter the look of area, bar, and win/loss series, and can be optionally displayed on the chart.

See the [Baseline](baseline.md) topic for more information.

## Hot Tracking

Hot tracking displays a customizable tooltip which contains the values of the data point closest to the end-user's mouse cursor.

See the [Hot Tracking](hot-tracking.md) topic for more information.

## Palettes

There are an enormous number of configuration options related to palettes.  The various brushes used by the chart can be easily customized using a palette of colors or the styles can be completely overridden.

See the [Palettes](palettes.md) topic for more information.

## Ranges

Specific value ranges of the chart can be highlighted to convey additional information to the end-user.

See the [Ranges](ranges.md) topic for more information.

## Series Visibility

The visibility of any series can be set to dictate whether or not it is rendered on the chart.

See the [Series Visibility](series-visibility.md) topic for more information.
