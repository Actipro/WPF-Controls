# Overview

Bar Code supports some advanced features such as drawing directly to a WPF `DrawingContext`, exporting bar codes to images, and use within XPS documents.

## Drawing to a DrawingContext

Bar codes can be rendered directly to a WPF `DrawingContext`.

See the [Drawing to a DrawingContext](drawing-context.md) topic for more information.

## Export to Image

Bar codes can easily be exported to any image format supported by WPF, including PNG, BMP, GIF, JPEG, and TIFF image formats.

See the [Export to Image](export-to-image.md) topic for more information.

## Validation Rules

Each symbology included with Actipro Bar code has a related `ValidationRule` implementation that may be used when data binding in XAML to ensure that a value supplied is supported by the symbology.

See the [Validation Rules](validation-rules.md) topic for more information.
