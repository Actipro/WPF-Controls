			<Paragraph>
				This sample shows how to integrate Docking &amp; MDI for WPF into a Prism application, using MVVM and Unity (for inversion of control/dependency injection).
				The sample leverages the Actipro Docking/Prism Interop assembly to allow a DockSite to be defined as a region and includes 2 document windows and 3 tool windows.
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph>
				The Solution Explorer and Class View tool windows include both a view-model and a view, which is applied using an implicit DataTemplate.
				These two view-models are added to the DockSite region using view discovery, and the views are applied as needed.
				The Toolbox tool window does not include a view-model, but instead adds it's view to the DockSite region directly, again using view discovery.
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph>
				The two document windows also include both a view-model and a view, again applied using an implicit DataTemplate.
				Unlike the tool windows, the document windows use view injection.
			</Paragraph>
			<Paragraph>
				The choice between using view discovery and view injection was arbitrarily made for demonstration purposes only.
				The document windows could use view discovery and/or the tool windows could use view injection.
				This is done simply to show the various ways things can be designed.
