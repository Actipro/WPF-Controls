	<Paragraph>
		In this demo, we've reimagined the user interface of a Notepad-like application using Themes, SyntaxEditor, and Docking/MDI.
		Actipro's native control themes mesh cohesively with Actipro custom control products.
		WindowChrome themes the Window and allows custom content like our TitleBarMenu in the Window's title bar area.
		SyntaxEditor provides improved selection and editing features over a normal TextBox.
		And Docking/MDI is used to provide a tabbed MDI user interface.
