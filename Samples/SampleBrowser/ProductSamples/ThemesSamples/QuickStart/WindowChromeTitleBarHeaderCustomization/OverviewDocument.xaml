	<Paragraph>
		WindowChrome supports placement of custom content in the left, header, and right areas of the title bar.
	</Paragraph>
	
	<Paragraph>
		This sample shows an example of putting a center-aligned PopupButton in the title bar header.
		The PopupButton's content is the window's title text, which is bound by default to the attached WindowChrome.TitleBarHeader property.
		A view-model object could just as easily be set to the attached WindowChrome.TitleBarHeader property and used as the
		TitleBarHeaderTemplate's DataContext instead.
