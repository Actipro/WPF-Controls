	<Paragraph>
		WindowChrome automatically replaces the Win32-based system title bar context menu with a custom WPF-based one with similar functionality.
		There are several benefit to this.
	</Paragraph>

	<Paragraph>
		First, the menu will use whatever ContextMenu and MenuItem styles are active in your application.
		This ensures that the system title bar context menu renders in the same style as other menus in your application.
		If you use Actipro Themes with native control theming enabled, the context menu can render in dark theme, etc.
	</Paragraph>

	<Paragraph>
		Second, since a custom WPF context menu is being created, the menu can be fully-customized prior to being opened.
		This sample shows how a 'Help' menu item can be injected into the system title bar context menu.
	</Paragraph>

	<Paragraph>
		Right-click the window title bar or click the window icon to see the custom menu.
