	<Paragraph>
		WindowChrome has built-in support for allowing the system to render Mica and Acrylic textures over
		the transparent background portion of a window.
	</Paragraph>

	<Paragraph>
		The Mica texture is an opaque, dynamic material that incorporates theme and desktop wallpaper to paint the background of long-lived main windows.
		The Acrylic texture is translucent and is used more on transient windows to add depth and establish a visual hierarchy.
	</Paragraph>

	<Paragraph>
		Please note that each texture has specific Windows version requirements that are described in the documentation.
		For instance, Mica requires Windows 11 or later.
