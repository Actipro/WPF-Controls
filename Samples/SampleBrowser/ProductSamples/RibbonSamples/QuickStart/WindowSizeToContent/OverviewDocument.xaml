	<Paragraph>
		Actipro Ribbon's advanced layout procedures allow you to use a parent Window's SizeToContent
		property to auto-size the width/height of the window.
		When the parent window is calculating its ideal size, it will consider the Group objects that are currently displayed for the selected Tab.
		From the ribbon's point of view, the ideal width is the sum of the large variant widths of the visible groups 
		added to the other border adornments surrounding the tabs and groups.
	</Paragraph>

	<Paragraph>
		When this sample's Window is displayed, you will notice that its size is exactly wide enough to 
		display the large variants of all the Home tab groups.
		This is assuming your monitor's resolution is high enough to display the width of all the large variants.
		The only code used to accomplish this was to set the window's SizeToContent property in the XAML.
	</Paragraph>
	
	<Paragraph>
		If you select another tab (without manually resizing the window first), you will see the window width continues to 
		size to its content.  Once you manually resize the window by dragging its border, you exit size-to-content mode.
