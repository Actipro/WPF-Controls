	<Paragraph>
		The ribbon control fully supports layout transform-based scaling.  
	</Paragraph>
	
	<sampleBrowser:ExternalSampleLauncherUIContainer />

	<Paragraph>
		As you scale the ribbon up and down in size via a ScaleTransform applied to its
		LayoutTransform property, all of its UI and contained UI scale as well.
		This includes popups like the application menu, etc.
	</Paragraph>
	<Paragraph>
		Best of all, since ribbon is drawn using vectors, all the UI remains crisp and clear even when scaled up in size.
	</Paragraph>
	
	<Paragraph>
		Use the Slider in the status bar of this sample window to adjust the scaling of the Ribbon.
		This shows how easily you can make your user interface more accessible for the visually impaired.
	</Paragraph>
