	<Paragraph>
		A Backstage control can be set to the Ribbon.ApplicationMenu to add
		support for the Backstage application menu, first added in Office 2010.
		Backstage is a tab control where each tab is a BackstageTab and
		the selected tab's content can display on the right side of the Backstage.
		Button controls can also be inserted into the Backstage and can be
		rendered above, below, or in between tabs, usually for common application functions such as save and close.

		Backstage supports the use of the RecentDocumentMenu, and TaskTabControl and TaskTabItem controls are included to allow
		for easy insertion of secondary-level tab controls that match the look of those in Office's Backstage tabs.
		Custom styles are provided for the Button, PopupButton, and Separator controls that are intended for use when the controls
		are located in the Backstage tab content area.
