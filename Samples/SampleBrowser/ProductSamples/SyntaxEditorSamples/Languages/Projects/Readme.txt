Language project (.langproj) files are edited via the Language Designer application
and are not intended for distribution with your applications.

While editing a language project in the Language Designer, language code can be 
generated either in code file (C#/VB) form or in language definition (.langdef)
file form.

These generated code files are intended to be distributed with your applications.

Language definition (.langdef) files related to the language projects are included
in the sibling Definitions folder.
