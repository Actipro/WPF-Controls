	<Paragraph>
		A Backstage is used in many modern applications to provide a richer experience for the user than is typically
		available from a traditional menu. Ribbon's Backstage mimics the Office user interface, providing a full-screen
		view that can be customized with any content to meet the individual needs of the application.

		This sample introduces the core concepts of the Backstage. Our more full-featured demo also utilizes the
		Backstage and provides additional examples for how the Backstage might be used in a real application.
